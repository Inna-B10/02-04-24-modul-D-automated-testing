# Automated Testing

## Overview

A short introduction to testing, test automation and Continous Integration.

## Types of Tests Explained

Testing is a critical part of software development that ensures your code behaves as expected. Let's dive into the different types of tests you'll encounter:

### Unit Testing

Unit tests are the foundation of a solid test suite, focusing on individual functions or components. These tests validate that your code performs correctly under various conditions, including handling inputs, processing data, and managing errors. By isolating each part of your application, you can quickly identify and fix bugs.

#### Tools:

- [Vitest]
- [Jest]

### Integration Testing

Integration testing examines how multiple units work together. For example, testing the interaction between a button component and the API it calls upon click ensures they integrate seamlessly. These tests are crucial for catching issues that unit tests might miss, such as problems with data flow or API integration.

#### Tools:

- [Testing Library React] with [Vitest] (or [Jest]).

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E testing simulates real user scenarios to ensure the application performs as designed from start to finish. It involves automating interactions with your application in a browser environment to test critical user flows, such as signing up or completing a transaction.

#### Tools:

- [Cypress]
- [Playwright]
- [Selenium]

## Strategies for Effective Testing

### [Arrange, Act, Assert] (AAA)

The AAA pattern is a clear and structured approach to writing tests:

- **Arrange:** Set up the conditions for your test.
- **Act:** Execute the function or component you're testing.
- **Assert:** Verify the outcome matches your expectations.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the AAA pattern in a unit test:

```javascript
// Arrange
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Act
const result = add(2, 3);

// Assert
expect(result).toBe(5);
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Integrating testing into your CI pipeline ensures tests are automatically run with every commit, helping to catch and fix issues early. Tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Jenkins can automate this process, running your test suite on various environments and configurations.

## Conclusion

Testing is an essential skill for any frontend developer, helping to ensure your applications are robust and user-friendly. Start with unit tests to get comfortable with testing concepts, then gradually expand to integration and E2E tests as you build more complex features. Remember, the goal of testing is not to achieve 100% coverage but to provide confidence in your application's functionality and reliability. Happy testing!
